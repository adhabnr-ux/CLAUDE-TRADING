_Midday June 23: all 6 positions within guardrails. Broad AI chip selloff (basket de-risking) — NVDA -3%, MRVL -8.13% intraday (CPO delay sector noise). No thesis breaks. GOOGL AI talent departure (John Jumper to Anthropic) is a headwind to note for weekly review but does not trigger the stated invalidation condition. AMZN recovering today (+0.93%) with Prime Day live. VST +8.35% still the strongest performer. No cuts, no stops tightened. Stop audit 6/6 ✓._

**No C-rated positions.**

**Key notes for week (pre-market June 17):**
1. **FOMC decision 2:00 PM ET today.** 97% hold probability. Dot plot risk: hawkish removal of 2026 rate cut projection, possible 3 members projecting rate hikes. Warsh first meeting as Chair. Market-open routine places no new orders today. Post-2:00 PM, if MSFT breaks below USD 375.06, close routine at 3:50 PM must flag for June 18 open exit.
2. **MRVL S&P 500 mandatory buy window: June 17–20 (today through Friday).** Index funds tracking the S&P 500 must hold MRVL by June 20 close (effective June 22). MRVL +3.16% pre-market confirms buying has started.
3. **MSFT HIGH ALERT: 3.950pp buffer.** Cut trigger USD 375.06. FOMC hawkish surprise at 2:00 PM could push MSFT close to or through this level. Close routine MUST check MSFT price vs USD 375.06 and plan June 18 open exit if breached.
4. **AMZN review_by June 22 approaching.** Pre-market June 22 MUST include explicit hold/trim/exit decision and contract renewal.
5. **VST ex-dividend June 22** (USD 0.229 × 52 = USD 11.91 to cash).
6. **AMD re-entry blocked** until AMD recovers above entry USD 508.43.

**Key notes for Week 3 (market-open June 16):**
1. MRVL: S&P 500 inclusion June 22 — index funds must own by June 20 close. "Massive news" confirmed (Motley Fool June 16). FY2028 outlook raised to USD 16.5B.
2. FOMC in session June 16–17. Expected hold at 3.50–3.75%. First meeting under new Chair Kevin Warsh. Decision tomorrow. MSFT softness (-1.62% intraday) reflects FOMC growth-multiple compression — not a thesis break.
3. Iran deal SIGNED: Full Hormuz reopening + 60-day nuclear talks. Oil Brent USD 83. Macro overhang fully resolved.
4. VST ex-dividend June 22 (USD 0.229/share × 52 = USD 11.91 incoming to cash). New HWM USD 158.57 today — stop ratcheting up.
5. AMZN review_by June 22 — pre-market June 22 must include explicit hold/trim/exit decision.
6. META buffer: 7.46pp (comfortable; well above 4pp threshold). MSFT: 4.28pp (watchpoint — midday must check).
7. AMD re-entry: blocked until AMD recovers above USD 508.43.
8. No trades today: FOMC uncertainty + stop audit passed 8/8 + all 8 theses intact.
